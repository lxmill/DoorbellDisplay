# DoorbellDisplay
The doorbell display showcases the current date and time initially. It then smoothly shifts to indicate the establishment's open status, displaying a prominent message at the top. Finally, it transitions to a hand pointing to the right, guiding visitors towards the location of the doorbell.

The button UP allows to change the state of OPEN/CLOSED to the opposite of the current state.
The button DOWN allows to update the message displayed at the top.
